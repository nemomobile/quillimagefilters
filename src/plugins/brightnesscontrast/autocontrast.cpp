/*!
  The contrast stretching algorithm works this way:
  * Build histogram
  * Set new low so that .5% of samples are under it
  * Set new high to that 99.5% of samples are under it
  *
  * Since this is quite slow, it should operate on preview size only!
  */

/*!
  This explaination is for auto fix
  * auto contrast will be executed firstly
  * auto color will be followed automatically
